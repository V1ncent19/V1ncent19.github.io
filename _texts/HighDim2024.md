***Still Updating***

Some reading notes following the following books on high dimensional statistics:


- **MJW**: *High-Dimensional Statistics: A Non-Asymptotic Viewpoint* by Martin J. Wainwright
- **RV**: *High-Dimensional Probability: An Introduction with Applications in Data Science* by Roman Vershynin
- **RH**: *High-Dimensional Statistics Lecture Notes* by Philippe Rigollet and Jan-Christian HÃ¼tter
- **RvH**: *Probability in High Dimension - APC 550 Lecture Notes* by Ramon van Handel

Cross-referencing/labelling coherence between chapters is not guaranteed. (But I at least maintained within-chapter coherence.)
