### Project on GitHub | [A Brief Summary of Statistics Course](https://github.com/V1ncent19/Statistics-Course-Summary-LaTeX)

The statistics course summary actually started from the exam cheetsheets during my first year in minor. At first it only contained some notion explanation / important results. Later I began to add mathematical deductions, intuition of methods, useful external links, etc. [LaTeX](https://www.ctan.org/) is used to compile so that I could include cross reference, citation, index in the note so that I could look something up in case of forgetting. Also I treat it as an opportunity to practice LaTeX.

Since it's written as a reminder, I may not contain some basic knowledge like calculus, linear algebra, etc. Besides, for consistency within file and familiarity for myself, I might not use some commonly used notations (An example may be the size of designed matrix. I use $$(p+1)\times n$$ while some others use $$p\times n$$). I will consider adding notation declarations later...

### Acknowledgments

The project is mostly based on the course content of statistics minor in [Center of Statistical Science](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I would like to express my gratitude to the faculty for their careful preparation and for their help to me. They include (in the order I first took their courses): Wanlu Deng, Jiangdian Wang, Zaiying Zhou, Dong Li, Tianying Wang, Sheng Yu, Pengkun Yang. 

In particular, I would like to express my appreciation to Professor [Zaiying Zhou](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/teambuilder/faculty/zaiying-zhou/) for her guidance, encouragement and inspiration, which are largely the driving force for my further study into the field of statistics.

And I would like to thank my classmates Mai Zhang and Yong Qin, who offered me help my discussing problems and tackling capstone projects. I learned a lot from them, both in knowledge and the way they study.
