- Calligraphy (mostly hard tip); the main fonts I follow are [唐小楷灵飞经](http://hanmofengya.com/works/TangDai/tangren/lingfeijing) and [董其昌信心铭](https://book.douban.com/subject/26900047/). Currently, the level has greatly degraded, some samples see <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/photos/cal.png">here</a>.
